Unless otherwise noted, the `*.gz`files were generated by the `gzip` command
line tool and the `*.deflate` and `*.zlib` versions were then generated by
`script/extract-deflate-offsets.go`. Similarly, the `*.giflzw` files were
generated by `script/extract-giflzw.go` and the `*.palette` and `*.indexes`
files were generated by `script/extract-palette-indexes.go`. The `*.tokens`
files were generated by `script/print-json-token-debug-format.c`.

The `*.jpeg` files are usually the canonical versions of the test/data images,
and other versions (`*.bmp`, `*.gif`, `*.png`, `*.tiff`) were generated by
ImageMagick's `convert` command line tool. The `*.wbmp` versions were generated
by the `script/convert-png-to-wbmp.go` command line tool. The `*.webp` versions
were generated by the cwebp command line tool.

The artificial directory holds artificially generated test data, often to
explicitly test corner cases of various file formats. The files there usually
come in families whose names have a common prefix, such as three files
`foo.bar`, `foo.bar.qux`, `foo.bar.commentary.txt` all prefixed by `foo.bar`.
The file whose name is that prefix is usually the canonical (typically
hand-crafted) file, and the other files are then derived from that. Outside of
the artificial directory, the other files in this directory are typically real
world examples of various file formats, or deriviations of them.
