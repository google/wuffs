# This GIF image contains four frames, each of which are outside the nominal
# image's bounds: (0, 0) - (2, 2):
#
#  - frame #0 has bounds (1, 0) - (4, 1).
#  - frame #1 has bounds (0, 1) - (2, 3).
#  - frame #2 has bounds (0, 4) - (1, 5).
#  - frame #3 has bounds (2, 0) - (6, 3).
#
# Here are some (but not all) possible decoding policies:
#
#  0. Reject it.
#  1. Keep   the image width×height at 2×2, clip all of the frames.
#  2. Adjust the image width×height to 3×1, the first frame's size, move
#     frame #0's top-left to be (0, 0), and clip subsequent frames.
#  3. Adjust the image width×height to 4×1, the first frame's bottom-right
#     corner, and clip subsequent frames.
#  4. Expand the image width×height to 4×2, the union of the image and first
#     frame's bounds, and clip subsequent frames.
#  5. Expand the image width×height to 4×5, so that no frames are clipped. This
#     needs to decode all frames before being able to report the image bounds.
#
# The GIF specification (https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt) calls
# for policy 0, rejection, as it says that "Each image must fit within the
# boundaries of the Logical Screen, as defined in the Logical Screen
# Descriptor". The spec uses "image" and "screen" for what Wuffs calls "frame"
# and "image".
#
# In practice, real world encoders violate the spec, and real world decoders
# have responded by accepting such files anyway. As of May 2018:
#
#  - Chromium chooses policy 4:
#    https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/image-decoders/gif/gif_image_reader.cc?rcl=5161173c43324da2b13e1aa45bbe69901daa1279&l=740
#
#  - Firefox chooses policy 2:
#    https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b75acf9652937ce79a9bf02de843c100db0e5ec7/image/decoders/nsGIFDecoder2.cpp#814
#
#  - Go chooses policy 0:
#    https://github.com/golang/go/blob/d3beea8c529a20b9eebb5ff8c22684af5ee1c920/src/image/gif/reader.go#L508
#    but a surprised user filed https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20856 when
#    Go rejected some (off-spec) GIF files that other decoders accept.
#
#  - gdk-pixbuf chooses policy 1:
#    https://github.com/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf/blob/c1fd9f5d6592c0183c54efc806b3ca6871e1f496/gdk-pixbuf/io-gif.c#L992
#
#  - giflib enforces no particular policy. It provides image and frame bounds
#    as encoded in the file and leaves it up to the caller how to respond.
#
# Wuffs chooses policy 4, the same as Chromium.
