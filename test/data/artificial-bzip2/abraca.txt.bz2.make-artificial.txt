# This script generates test/data/abraca.txt.bz2 exactly, following the
# description in std/bzip2/README.md and its bitslices (a) ..= (s).
#
# By itself, this isn't a very interesting foo.make-artificial.txt file, in
# that it doesn't make *artificial* bzip2 test data (as opposed to test data
# *naturally* created by the /usr/bin/bzip2 tool). But this file is a useful
# diff-base for other bar.make-artificial.txt files in the same directory.
