# JPEG Images

`script/confirm-matches-djpeg.sh test/3pdata/blinksuite | grep Differ` gives 5
test files for which Wuffs' `example/convert-to-nia` and libjpeg-turbo's
`djpeg` do not match:

```
Differ (other)  test/3pdata/blinksuite/182.jpg
Differ (large)  test/3pdata/blinksuite/large-size-image-crash.jpeg
Differ (trunc)  test/3pdata/blinksuite/missing-eoi.jpg
Differ (trunc)  test/3pdata/blinksuite/non-interleaved_progressive-1.jpg
Differ (trunc)  test/3pdata/blinksuite/non-interleaved_progressive.jpg
```

We'll discuss these in simple to complex order, which happens to be the
opposite of the alphabetical order they're listed above.

---

The last three are truncated JPEG files. Like most image file format
specifications, the JPEG specification doesn't mandate exactly how to decode
*invalid* input (including truncated input), and it's reasonable for Wuffs and
libjpeg-turbo to produce slightly different outputs here. Wuffs' [commit
a3cecef6](https://github.com/google/wuffs/commit/a3cecef69aa04f1145f0c84b92481e8abd51c2c3)
"std/jpeg: decode truncated JPEGs on MCU boundaries" discusses some of the
performance trade-offs if Wuffs were to try to exactly match on all input, not
just on well-formed JPEGs.

As pointed out by the a3cecef6 commit message, matching libjpeg-turbo exactly
doesn't necessarily give better output. Here's two JPEG images (one sequential,
one progressive, both truncated to 1 KiB) decoded by Wuffs:

![Decoding by Wuffs](../data/peacock.default.truncated.decoded-by-wuffs.png)
![Decoding by Wuffs](../data/peacock.progressive.truncated.decoded-by-wuffs.png)

Here's the same input, this time decoded by libjpeg-turbo:

![Decoding by djpeg](../data/peacock.default.truncated.decoded-by-djpeg.png)
![Decoding by djpeg](../data/peacock.progressive.truncated.decoded-by-djpeg.png)

Zoom in on all four images (in four different tabs, if viewing in a browser),
and the first pair isn't obviously better or worse than the second pair.

`test/3pdata/blinksuite/large-size-image-crash.jpeg` is simply a very large
image (in terms of pixels: 48010 × 16173), even though the file itself is
merely 347 bytes. At 4 bytes per pixel, 48010 × 16173 × 4 ≈ 2962 MiB exceeds
`example/convert-to-nia` maximum pixel buffer size.

```
$ file test/3pdata/blinksuite/large-size-image-crash.jpeg
test/3pdata/blinksuite/large-size-image-crash.jpeg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 48010x16173, components 3

$ grep define.PIXBUF_ARRAY_SIZE example/convert-to-nia/convert-to-nia.c
#define PIXBUF_ARRAY_SIZE (256 * 1024 * 1024)
```

The file itself is merely 347 bytes long. Even if we patched
`example/convert-to-nia` to allow larger pixel buffers, it's a truncated image
like the first three we discussed, above.

```
$ djpeg test/3pdata/blinksuite/large-size-image-crash.jpeg > /dev/null
Premature end of JPEG file
```

That file is in the test suite presumably to check that decoders don't crash or
trigger buffer overflows, and `example/convert-to-nia` does neither here.

---

`test/3pdata/blinksuite/182.jpg` is our final example (first in alphabetical
order but last in discussion order) of where Wuffs and libjpeg-turbo differ.

Once again, different JPEG implementations have some leeway on how to treat
*invalid* JPEGs, and this JPEG is invalid.

```
$ djpeg test/3pdata/blinksuite/182.jpg > /dev/null
Corrupt JPEG data: 29 extraneous bytes before marker 0xc4
```

As of Wuffs' [commit
186bdc5f](https://github.com/google/wuffs/commit/186bdc5fe2eedaa2869123aa7954ed9a4582e895)
"Roll back 'decode truncated... on MCU boundaries'" and libjpeg-turbo v3.0.1,
here are the two decodings (Wuffs' and djpeg's):

![Wuffs decoding of 0-original](./asset/182.0-original.wuffs.png)
![djpeg decoding of 0-original](./asset/182.0-original.djpeg.png)

When zooming in, the two are indeed different, but both decodings look like
garbage and it's not clear that one is better than the other (although djpeg's
output seems to have more 'detail' that Wuffs' output is missing).

Let's look at the hex dump of the `test/3pdata/blinksuite/182.jpg` file, copied
into this repo as `test/3pdata/asset/182.0-original.jpg`

```

Note that this JPEG has multiple `0xFF 0xDA` Start Of Scan markers, but the
`0xFF 0xC0` at position `0x0000009E` denotes a *sequential* JPEG, not a
*progressive* JPEG. It's highly unusual for a non-progressive JPEG to have
multiple scans.

At position `0x000000E3` there are the two bytes `0xFE 0xDA` which is *not* a
Start of Scan (because it's `0xFE`, not `0xFF`). This (continuing up to but
excluding the `0xFF 0xC4` Define Huffman Table marker at position `0x00000100`)
causes the "Corrupt JPEG data: 29 extraneous bytes before marker 0xc4" error
message seen above.

The first recognized `0xFF 0xDA` Start of Scan is actually at position
`0x00000120` and the `0x01` byte at position `0x00000124` means that the *scan*
has only one component. In contrast, the `0x03` byte at position `0x000000A7`
means that the *frame* has three components (the typical Y, Cb, Cr).

Thus, we have a *sequential* JPEG with multiple scans, but also whose first
scan doesn't cover all of the components. Highly, highly unusual, and the cause
of why Wuffs and libjpeg-turbo differ in its output.

Specifically, decoding progressive JPEGs require more memory than decoding
sequential JPEGs, since decoding progressive JPEGs needs somewhere to store 'in
progress' (partially reconstructed) pre-IDCT coefficients. Wuffs-the-language
doesn't allow Wuffs code to allocate memory at arbitrary times. Instead, for
Wuffs image decoding, there is only one point in time where the Wuffs-callee
can advise its caller how much memory it will need for its "work buffer". This
point in time is after the image configuration (width, height, color model,
etc) has been decoded but before actual pixels have been decoded. For the JPEG
file format, "decode the image configuration" corresponds to parsing the `0xFF
0xC0` Start of Frame (Baseline Sequential) marker.

When Wuffs decodes `182.jpg`, the JPEG file's Start Of Frame says "I'm a
*sequential* JPEG", so Wuffs *doesn't* ask its caller for that extra memory.
Even though it turns out that the JPEG file has multiple scans, those scans
*aren't* accumulated (in that non-existent extra memory).

When libjpeg-turbo decodes `182.jpg`, it sees "I'm a *sequential* JPEG" but,
when it also sees that the first scan has incomplete component coverage, it
goes ahead and allocates that extra memory. The multiple scans *are*
accumulated and the final pixel output is different (and more 'detailed').

In theory, it'd be possible to modify Wuffs' JPEG decoder so that "decode the
image configuration" actually peeked ahead to the first scan. But that adds
complexity to the implementation. It's hard to justify that additional cost
just to handle highly, highly unusual JPEGs like the invalid (corrupted)
`182.jpg` differently, especially just to produce different *garbage*.

A final remark: sequential versus progressive JPEGs also differ in how to
handle the Huffman data in each scan. If we modify only 1 byte in
`182.0-original.jpg` to give `182.1-byte-change.jpg`, changing the byte at
position `0x0000009F` from `0xC0` to `0xC2`:

```diff
- 00000090  63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63  63 63 63 63 63 63 ff c0  |cccccccccccccc..|
+ 00000090  63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63  63 63 63 63 63 63 ff c2  |cccccccccccccc..|
```

This changes the JPEG from sequential to progressive. After doing that, Wuffs
and libjpeg-turbo agree *exactly* on what its decoding is (as both ask for and
use that extra memory). It also no longer looks like garbage. It looks like a
kitty!

![Decoding of 1-byte-change](./asset/182.1-byte-change.png)

If we also fix the corruption by changing the `0xFE` to `0xFF` at position
`0x000000E3`, so that we've changed 2 bytes overall, it looks like an even
better kitty (and both decoders still agree).
