This directory contains documentation about Wuffs' two aspects:

- A [programming language](/doc/wuffs-the-language.md).
- A [standard library](/doc/wuffs-the-library.md) written in that programming
  language.

"[Getting Started](/doc/getting-started.md)" has some suggestions if you're
new. The [top level README](/README.md) also has some general remarks.
