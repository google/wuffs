- `wuffsfmt` double-indents hanging lines and each indent is now 4 spaces (not
  a tab).


## 2024-04-19 version 0.3.4

- Have `std/png` ignore tRNS chunks for color types 4 (YA) and 6 (RGBA).


## 2023-04-08 version 0.3.3

The `wuffs_base__parse_number_f64` function has been further optimized.


## 2023-04-07 version 0.3.2

The `std/bmp` and `std/nie` image decoders' `decode_frame` method now allow
decoding to a pixel buffer that's smaller than the source image. This makes
these two image decoders consistent with the other ones in `std`.


## 2023-03-04 version 0.3.1

For a *closed* `io_reader`, the standard library now returns `"#truncated
input"` instead of `"$short read"`. Importantly, this is an error, not a
suspension.

The `wuffs_base__parse_number_f64` function's Simple Decimal Conversion
fallback algorithm has been optimized.


## 2023-01-26 version 0.3.0

The headline feature is that we have a production quality PNG decoder. It's
also [the fastest, safest PNG decoder in the
world](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2021/fastest-safest-png-decoder.html).
There's also a [memory-safe, zero-allocation JSON
decoder](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/jsonptr.html).

## 2019-12-19 version 0.2.0

The headline feature is that the GIF decoder is now of production quality.
There is now API for overall metadata (e.g. ICCP color profiles) and to
recreate each frame (width, height, BGRA pixels, timing, etc.) of a GIF
animation, instead of version 0.1's proof-of-concept GIF decoder API, which
just gave you a one-dimensional stream of palette indexes. It also now accepts
a variety of GIF images that are invalid, when strictly following the GIF
specifiction, but are nonetheless accepted by other real world GIF
implementations. The Wuffs GIF decoder has also been optimized to be about 1.5x
faster than Wuffs version 0.1 and about 2x faster than giflib (the C library).

The Wuffs GIF decoder is being trialled by Skia, the 2-D graphics library used
by both the Android operating system and the Chromium web browser.

Work also proceeds on the NIE and RAC file formats, but both are still
experimental and may change later in backwards incompatible ways.
